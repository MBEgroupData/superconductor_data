### Pixel Intensity Histogram:

#### Curve 1
**Type**: Skewed Gaussian\
**amplitude** 12439.2\
**mean**: 123.0\
**σ1**: 33.3\
**σ2**: 13.4

#### Curve 2
**Type:** Gaussian\
**amplitude:** 3352.1\
**mean:** 150.0\
**σ:** 19.6

### S<sup>2</sup>
Due to the center of curve 1 being within 1σ of the center of
curve 2, the threshold taken 1σ above the mean of curve 2.

Due to the sharp distribution of pixel intensity between
169 and 170, the average value of their S<sup>2</sup> values
was used to obtain the S<sup>2</sup> of this film.



**Threshold Value:** 169\
**Area:** 3.15%\
**S^2:** .0315

**Threshold Value:** 170\
**Area:** 1.90%\
**S^2:** 0.019

**S<sup>2</sup>:** 0.02525


**T<sub>C</sub>:**  7.23 K
