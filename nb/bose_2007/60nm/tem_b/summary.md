## Pixel Intensity Histogram Fit

#### Curve 1 (Ordered Peak)
**Type**: Gaussian\
**amplitude** 28553.7\
**center**: 71\
**σ**: 2.89

#### Curve 2 (Disordered Peak)
**Type**: Gaussian\
**amplitude** 3761.0\
**center**: 94\
**σ**: 25.4



## S<sup>2</sup>
In dark-field TEM images, the ordered regions will have lower pixel intensity
than the disordered regions. Thus, pixel intensities below the threshold are
set to 255 and the above the threshold the pixels are set to 0.

Due to the center of curve 2 being within 1σ of the center of
curve 1, the threshold value is set at 1σ below the center of curve 1.

**Threshold Value:** 68\
**Ordered Area Percentage:** 3.89%

**Threshold Value:** 69\
**Ordered Area Percentage:** 8.31%
